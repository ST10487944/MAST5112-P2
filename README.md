# MAST5112-P2
This mobile application was developed as part of my MAST5112 POE and this is just part 2 of the POE.
So this project is based on a restaurant called Chrisoteffel and the application was developed to help manage the restaurant's menu digitally.
This application helps users to add, view, filter and remove menu items.
Each dish includes the name, description, course and price of the item.

The project is based on the UI designs and Mockups I created on Part 1of the assignment.

The purpose of this project is to show that I can convert a user interface design into a real working design app and also display and manage data using states and lists.
